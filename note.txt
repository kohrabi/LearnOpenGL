A VBO (Vertex Buffer Object) is used to store the vertex data

So Vertex Attributes is like the location within the shader (location = 0) (Thuộc tính ấy kiểu vậy).
This will be take data from the currently bounded VBO

A VAO (Vertex Array Object) is used to store the vertex configuration so that you only have to 
configure it once and use to draw everytime.

element buffer objects (EBO) basically index the indices to draw

Texture Unit tells OpenGL what "texture location" to bind to. Have to be set manually by dev through uniform and
BindTexture Slot.

NDC (Normalized device coordinates): the space in which opengl rasterize vertex into pixel
Local Space(Object Space): where the vertex is comparing to the local origin
Model Matrix
World Space: where the object is comparing to the world origin
View Matrix
View Space: the object relative to the camera
Projection Matrix
Clip Space: Determine which vertex is going to be on screen
